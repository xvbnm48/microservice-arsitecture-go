Microservices itu adalah suatu framework Architecture yang dipakai sebagai model dalam pembuatan aplikasi cloud yang modern. Di dalam microservices setiap aplikasi di bangun sebagai sekumpulan service dan setiap layanan berjalan dalam processnya sendiri. Masing-masing dari aplikasi tersebut saling berkomunikasi melalu API (Application Programing Interface).

As the name implies, a microservices architecture is an approach to building a server application as a set of small services. That means a microservices architecture is mainly oriented to the back-end, although the approach is also being used for the front end. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other processes using protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP. Each microservice implements a specific end-to-end domain or business capability within a certain context boundary, and each must be developed autonomously and be deployable independently. Finally, each microservice should own its related domain data model and domain logic (sovereignty and decentralized data management) and could be based on different data storage technologies (SQL, NoSQL) and different programming languages!.
